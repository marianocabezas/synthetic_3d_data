# Synthetic 3D data
Synthetic dataset experiments for image classification networks
- [ ] #1 Shape-based classes (cubes vs spheres)
- [ ] Location-based classes (spheres in image quadrants - T)
- [ ] Scale-based classes (spheres of different scales - S)
- [ ] Rotation-based classes (cubes at different angles - R)
- [ ] Texture-based classes A (gradients)
- [ ]  Texture-based classes B (parcellation-based contrasts)
